      <h1>My Education Background</h1>
      <h2><em>Overall Semester Experience</em></h2>

Semester 1 is very challenging as most of us never had experienced university life before,My life began a new chapter when I entered Universiti Teknologi MARA (UiTM) for the first time. It was an experience I will never forget. Everything felt new, thrilling, and overwhelming all at once to someone who had never known campus life before. I knew right away when I walked onto campus that things would be different from what I was used to. I had never encountered a environment, people, or educational system like this before.<p></p>

Getting used to the academic lifestyle was one of my initial difficulties. Unlike school, where everything was outlined in detail, university life involve a great deal of freedom. I had to pick up time management skills fast, as well as how to plan my work and remember due dates. Effective time management also important as for critical survival skill. With so many classes, group projects, and curriculum activities, I came to the conclusion that preparation was now necessary rather than making it optional.<p></p>

<h5>Making Friends Experience</h5>
Another significant aspect of my journey was making friends. I initially felt a little out of place, but I quickly began to meet individuals from other places, and backgrounds. Everyone had their own narrative, and it was great to witness how diverse and lively UiTM’s community was as there is an event and food festival for some week with many variations of food and going there with friends is such a nice experience. I became more friendly, talked to more people, and even collaborated with students on a variety of group projects. My days on campus were much more pleasurable because of these friendships, which also made me feel likes home. As every semester going, there is sad and happy times i have go through and the one I mostly remembered is where <strong>my bestfriend</strong>, Lazman, decided to leave the university we were attending together after getting an offer to study something he is more interested in and passionate about. From time to time the sadness was gone as I learn deeper that people come and go.<p></p>

UiTM has the feel of a separate classes and block. There were several of locations to explore, including academic buildings, study areas, cafeterias, and peaceful green areas. Outside of university, I travelled to the towns and learnt more about Kedah. From cuisine to famous spot here, it seemed as though I was acquiring life experience and cultural understanding in addition to academic information.<p></p>

Adapting to the university's learning style was one of the most significant changes I had to make while I was in school, waking up early at 6 AM seems easy for me but once i go into university, classes at 8 AM seems so heavy to wake up but from time to time i become adapted to it and it becomes easier like school era. The pace of the lectures increased, and the instructors wanted us to actively participate in our education. I made it a point to remain devoted because attendance was also treated seriously, missing three consecutive classes without cause could result in a warning letter. Additionally, I frequently had to push myself beyond my comfort zone, particularly when it came to public speaking. Group assignment and presentations became throughout my academic career, and I gradually became more confidence.<p></p>

<h5>Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar (MPP)</h5>
On <strong>semester 3</strong>here is a moment where I was pushed to join some events by my lecturer which that program is are some kind of big program as in UiTM, we have something called Majlis Perwakilan Pelajar (MPP), it’s like the student council. They’re the ones who represent all of us students when it comes to voicing out our concerns, giving feedback to the university, and even organizing programs. Basically, they are the middleman between us and the university management which MPP play such a big role and responsibility in UiTM. As i had to join MPP selection program, I feel nervous as i am not used to talk in front of people where we need to <strong>give a speech</strong> in front of <strong> 1500 people </strong> can you imagine? speaking in front of a large audience while you yourself feeling very nervous while only presenting in front of classes where there is estimately like 20 student or something. As my turn has come, To my surprise, I managed to deliver the speech calmly and confidently even there is some stuck part since i forgot what to say , without even shaking. I’m truly proud of myself since I never used to give a speech in such a large crowd before, and this experience really pushed me out of my comfort zone.<p>

Right after the speech, every competitors will have a weeks of manifesto, where we will promote our manifesto, It could be our list of promises or plans to improve student life. Most students campaign via social media, posters, videos, or short speeches during class or events.<p>

<strong>Voting:</strong>
Students vote online (via iStudent Portal) Each student usually gets two vote for faculty MPP choosen. In the end 
the two with the highest number of votes wins. As I participate on this, i print my manifesto poster 30 times with 3 different design placed on different spot on the route student use everyday. As time have come, the result is been announced and even though I lost the MPP election with <storng>449 votes</strong>, I don’t feel disappointed at all. In fact, I’m truly grateful and happy because I got to experience something completely new and meaningful. Standing in front of thousand of people to give a speech was never easy for me — but that moment pushed me out of my comfort zone and helped me grow braver and more confident.<p>

What touched me the most is that 449 people believed in me and voted for me. That number means so much, especially knowing that my own batch total is estimately 120 students. It shows that others beyond my circle saw something in me, and for that, I’ll always be thankful This journey taught me that<strong> "winning isn’t always about the title. Sometimes, it’s about finding the courage to try, to step outside your comfort zone, and to realize that even in defeat, you are never alone."</strong> To everyone who believed in me — thank you. You’ve given me more than votes, you’ve given me confidence, purpose, and a memory I will carry forever.
