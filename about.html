      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Hiiiiiii!! My name is <strong>Syed Muhammad Danish Bin Syed Mohd Faisal </strong>. I am a student at UiTM Kedah, Merbok, currently taking the IML254 Web Design subject in Diploma in library informatics. Ever since I was young, I’ve always been fascinated by how things work, especially gadgets and websites. I still remember the first time I explored a simple HTML page and changed the background color. It felt like magic!! In that moment my interest in web development have become more interested to but still i need to improve from time to time as my HTML web is too simple and need proper arrangement and design. Now, as a student in IML254 subject, I’m excited to turn that dream into something real. As before i explain further, I am the second child of 4 siblings, all of my sibling is a boys which there is no girls at all. below is some of my biodata </p>

<h2><em>Personal Value</em></h2>

First of all, what I think something value on myself is I can get used to something fast which mean I'm <strong>adapting to the new environment</strong> easily even when I get lost on someplace or somewhere, I will get used to it and act normally while following the flow. Being calm is all we need to solve some sorts of problem where being panic doesn't help at all. I always being too kind to people and somewhat it become very bad as some people often take a granted of the kindness I made, most of them only need me when they are in trouble but when they aren't at trouble at all, they will never talk to me nor call me when they see me. As being kind is negative i learn from it and some quote mentioned...<strong> "Kindness is a gift, not a weakness, give it to those who value it, not to those who weigh it down with their silence, neglect, and pride.</strong> <p>

<h2><em>My Personality</h2></em>
At first i checked my Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) test to know myself better where in this test we need to answer a self-report  questionnaire that aims to identify individual personality preferences based on 16 distinct personality types, based on how they perceived the world and make decisions. As for me, the result of my MBTI i got <strong>ENFJ</strong> as my<strong> personality</strong> where ENFJ 
is a personality type with the Extraverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging traits. These types of personality love helping others, and they tend to have strong ideas and values. They back their perspective with the creative energy to achieve their goals. ENFJs strive to have a positive impact on other people and the world around them. ENFJs are born leaders, which explains why these personalities can be found among many notable politicians, coaches, and teachers. Their passion and charisma allow them to inspire others not just in their careers but in every arena of their lives, including their relationships. Few things bring people with the ENFJ personality type a deeper sense of joy and fulfillment than guiding friends and loved ones to grow into their best selves.<p> I don’t just listen to people — I try to feel what they feel. That’s how I connect, build trust, and create change. most of the times i love when my friends are happy, even when i went through hardship, i just want all of my friends to be happy and not sad but if they intentionally choose to be sad then i'll not tolerate with them HAHAHAH. If I believe in something, I’ll pour my whole heart into it — not for recognition, but because I care. Wellbeing others is very important to me that's all for my MBTI personality there's a lot more but maybe later hehe.
