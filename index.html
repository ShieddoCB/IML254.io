      <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
      <p>Hiiii guyss!!! My name is <strong>Syed Muhammad Danish Bin Syed Mohd Faisal</strong>. This website is a part of my IML254 Web Development individual project. in here, you will learn about me, my interests, journey and much more :D</p>

      <h2>Elaboration of My Topic</h2>
<p>
  As you explore this website, you will find it divided into several important sections that tell the story of who I am, what I love, and how I’ve grown. Each section represents a chapter of my life, designed to help you get to know me not just as a student, but as a person with passions, dreams, and meaningful experiences.
</p>

<h3>🧍‍♂️ About Me</h3>
<p>
  This section introduces you to the core of who I am. You will find basic personal information such as my full name, where I come from, my background, and a little insight into my personality. I will also share fun facts, quirks, and stories that define me as an individual. It’s more than just a biodata — it’s my story, told in my own words. This is the perfect place to understand my character, beliefs, and the things that matter most to me.
</p>

<h3>🎓 Education</h3>
<p>
  Here, I talk about my academic journey, from early schooling to my current studies in UiTM. You'll learn about the schools I’ve attended, the subjects I’ve excelled in, and the skills I've gained along the way. I’ll also reflect on the challenges I’ve overcome, the teachers who’ve inspired me, and my goals for the future. Education is not just about grades — it's about the growth and transformation I've gone through as a learner.
</p>

<h3>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family</h3>
<p>
  This part is dedicated to my family, the people who have shaped me into the person I am today. I will introduce my parents and siblings, their roles, personalities, and how we support each other. I believe family is the foundation of everything, and this section honors the love, care, and bonds we share. You’ll also get a glimpse into our traditions, special moments, and how we spend time together.
</p>

<h3>🎮 Hobbies / My Interests</h3>
<p>
  In this colorful and expressive section, I dive into what brings joy and excitement into my life. From my deep passion for <strong>bowling</strong> — a sport I love for its mix of precision and fun — to my obsession with <strong>video games</strong> like <em>Mobile Legends</em>, <em>Battle Cats</em>, and <em>PUBG</em>, you’ll see what makes me tick. I also elaborate on my taste in <strong>music</strong>, including artists like Arctic Monkeys, Gorillaz, Green Day, The Weeknd, and many more across various genres and languages. These hobbies aren’t just pastimes — they are escapes, challenges, and sometimes even inspiration that help me through life.
</p>

<h3>📸 Gallery</h3>
<p>
  A visual journey of my experiences, this section showcases photos and memories from different parts of my life. You’ll find pictures of my achievements, outings with friends and family, events I’ve joined, and other personal moments I’ve chosen to share. Think of this gallery as my digital memory wall — full of smiles, milestones, and everything in between.
</p>

<h3>📞 Contact</h3>
<p>
  This is the part where you can reach out to me. Whether you want to say hi, collaborate on something, or ask me questions about my project, all my contact information will be here — including email, Instagram, WhatsApp link, and more. I’ve made it easy and friendly to get in touch because I believe connection is important, especially in the digital age.
</p>

<p>
  By combining all these sections, this website becomes a complete and unique reflection of my life, not just as a student doing a project, but as a young person with stories, dreams, and purpose. I hope you enjoy browsing through my journey as much as I enjoyed creating and sharing it with you.
